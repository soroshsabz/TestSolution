<!--What is this file and why we use it?:
From Android 7.0 and on in order to share the files an app create, the app must create a File Provider
so that the app gives other apps a secure way and permission to access these files. In our case we download a
file and save it on device storage, and we use File provider to grant access other app i.e Package Installer,
otherwise a security exception will be thrown by Android OS.
